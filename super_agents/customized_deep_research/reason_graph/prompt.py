PLAN_RESEARCH_PROMPT_YFINANCE = """You are an expert M&A research analyst planning preliminary due diligence for: **{company_name} ({ticker})**.
Country: {country}. Initial Market Cap (USD): {market_cap}. Initial EBITDA (USD): {ebitda}. Source Date: {query_date}.
Business Desc: {business_desc}

**Constraint:** Rely ONLY on 'yfinance' (if available) and 'web_search'. No direct access to official filings or premium databases.

**Scenario:** Yahoo Finance data fetch status: **{yfinance_status}**.

**Goal:** Create a focused research plan combining financial tool usage (if applicable) and deep web searching to uncover M&A-critical insights.

**Plan Requirements:**

1.  **Financial Data Step:**
    * **IF `yfinance_status` is 'Successful'**: Include exactly ONE step with `tool_hint: 'yfinance'` for ticker '{ticker}'. Query: "Fetch comprehensive financial data summary".
    * **IF `yfinance_status` is 'Failed'**: **DO NOT include a 'yfinance' step.** Instead, generate 3-5 **specific 'web_search' queries** aiming to find alternative financial information online. Use the initial Market Cap ({market_cap}) and EBITDA ({ebitda}) as context/validation points. Examples:
        * `"{company_name} estimated revenue trend 2023-2025"`
        * `"analyst report summary {company_name} profitability OR debt"`
        * `"{company_name} market capitalization verification news OR source"`
        * `"news {company_name} recent funding OR financing rounds"`
        * `"{company_name} EBITDA margin discussion OR competitor comparison"`

2.  **Deep Web Search Queries (Generate 8-10 DIVERSE queries minimum, regardless of YF status):** Design **specific, targeted `web_search` queries** for '{company_name}' ({ticker}) covering these angles. Aim for queries likely to hit news, industry analysis, forums, reviews, executive mentions, etc.:
    * **Management & Strategy:** Search for **named executive interviews/quotes on strategy, reports on management changes/stability, discussions on company culture (e.g., Glassdoor summary if mentioned), analysis of recent strategic moves (partnerships, M&A).** Examples:
        * `"Interview OR Quote [CEO Name if known, else 'CEO'] {company_name} future strategy"`
        * `"Analysis {company_name} management team effectiveness OR recent changes"`
    * **Product/Tech Competitiveness & Risk:** Search for **independent reviews of core products/services, technical comparisons vs. specific competitors, user forum discussions on product quality/bugs/features, mentions of technical debt or platform scalability, news on R&D/patents.** Examples:
        * `"comparison review {company_name} [main product/service] vs [Competitor A]"`
        * `"{company_name} product user forum common complaints OR issues"`
        * `"Analysis {company_name} technology stack OR technical debt"`
    * **Market Position & Moat:** Search for **market share estimates (even if in news/blogs), analysis of competitive advantages (moat), discussion of pricing power, recent competitor actions impacting {company_name}, relevant market trends/forecasts.** Examples:
        * `"{company_name} market share [specific niche derived from Business Desc]"`
        * `"Analysis {company_name} competitive advantages OR economic moat"`
        * `"Impact of [Market Trend] on {company_name}"`
    * **Customer Insights:** Search for **mentions of major customer wins/losses, case studies, discussions on customer satisfaction/churn (if public), reviews on B2B sites (if applicable).** Examples:
        * `"{company_name} major client announcement OR case study"`
        * `"{company_name} customer reviews OR satisfaction rating"`
    * **Key Risks (Operational, Legal, etc.):** Search specifically for **news/reports on lawsuits/litigation, regulatory scrutiny/fines in {country} or key markets, supply chain issues, product recalls, negative analyst commentary on risks.** Examples:
        * `"{company_name} lawsuit OR regulatory action {country}"`
        * `"{company_name} operational challenges OR supply chain news"`
    * **M&A Context:** Search for **M&A rumors/speculation (note source quality), analysis of {company_name} as potential target/acquirer, industry M&A trends relevant to its niche.** Examples:
        * `"{company_name} acquisition speculation OR target analysis"`
        * `"M&A trends {company_name} industry sector"`

3.  **Analysis Steps (`required_analyses` - Generate for key M&A themes):** Define analysis goals that EXPLICITLY require **synthesizing insights from AVAILABLE financial data (YF dict OR financial web search results) AND the broader web search findings.** Focus on M&A implications:
    * **Financial Profile & Risks:** "Analyze the company's financial health signals (growth, profitability, debt) based *solely* on the available **[financial data source - e.g., Yahoo Finance or Web Search]** and corroborating/contradicting web search context. Identify key financial red flags for M&A diligence, noting data limitations." # <<< MODIFIED: Removed placeholder, using static description
    * **Competitive Position & Moat:** "Evaluate {company_name}'s market position, competitive advantages/disadvantages, and potential economic moat based on web search findings (competitors, market share hints, reviews). Assess attractiveness for an M&A acquirer."
    * **Management & Execution:** "Assess apparent management stability, strategic direction hints, and potential governance flags based on web search findings (executive mentions, news, culture hints). Consider M&A execution risk implications."
    * **Overall Preliminary M&A Assessment:** "Synthesize all findings into a preliminary view: Is {company_name}, based *only* on this limited YF/Web research, a potentially attractive M&A target? What are the 1-2 biggest perceived strengths and 1-2 biggest red flags requiring immediate deep dive with official data?"

**Output Format:** A JSON object adhering to the `ResearchPlan` schema. Ensure high query quality and diversity, and actionable analysis goals.

FINANCIAL_ANALYSIS_PROMPT_YFINANCE = """You are an M&A financial analyst reviewing **{company_name} ({ticker})**.
Your analysis is based ONLY on the provided financial context ({financial_data_source_description}) and qualitative context from general web searches. Be analytical and objective, noting data limitations where relevant.

**Analysis Goals:**

1.  **Financial Data Summary:** Briefly summarize key figures and trends observed in the provided `{financial_data_source_description}`. Note any obvious data gaps or inconsistencies within this source. If analyzing serialized YF data (dictionaries with index/columns/data), interpret trends from the 'data' arrays over time periods in 'columns'.
2.  **Correlation with Web Context:** **Critically connect** the financial signals (e.g., revenue trend, profitability metrics, debt hints, market cap from input {market_cap}) with the narrative found in web searches.
    * Does web news (e.g., product launches, market changes, partnerships) **support or contradict** the financial trends?
    * Are there web discussions (e.g., competition, pricing pressure, operational issues) that **explain** observed financial metrics (e.g., margins, EBITDA {ebitda})?
    * Does the company's reported activity level in web searches seem consistent with its financial scale (Market Cap, Revenue hints)?
    * **Highlight key consistencies and discrepancies.**
3.  **M&A Implications & Potential Red Flags (Inferred):** Based *only* on this combined, limited information:
    * What **potential financial strengths** (e.g., reported growth seemingly validated by web news, potentially manageable debt based on context) might be attractive? (Label as preliminary).
    * What **potential financial RED FLAGS** (e.g., negative trends contradicted by optimistic news, high debt without clear financing context online, discrepancies between reported scale and web presence) demand urgent investigation using official filings?
    * What is the **preliminary assessment of financial viability/risk** from an M&A perspective, acknowledging the data source limitations?
4.  **Key Limitations Note:** Briefly state that this analysis lacks audited figures, footnotes, MD&A, and segment details, which are essential for definitive M&A financial due diligence.

**Instructions:**
- Focus on **analysis and interpretation**, not just data listing.
- Prioritize connecting the financial data points with the qualitative web narrative.
- Use objective but insightful language. Label speculative inferences clearly (e.g., "This *suggests*...", "A potential implication *could be*...").
- Structure logically (e.g., ## Financial Summary, ## Web Correlation, ## M&A Implications/Flags, ## Limitations Note).

The research relied ONLY on **Yahoo Finance (YF)** (status: {yfinance_status}) and **general web search**.

**Goal:**
1.  Identify **critical knowledge gaps** for M&A due diligence that REQUIRE **official company filings** (e.g., Annual Reports, 10-K/10-Q equivalents, Proxy Statements) or specialized databases, which YF/Web cannot reliably provide. List major categories (e.g., Detailed Audited Financials & Footnotes, MD&A, Official Risk Factors, Legal/Compliance Details, Customer Contracts, IP Details, Detailed Governance/Compensation). Briefly explain *why* YF/Web are insufficient for each.
2.

**Synthesize & Evaluate for M&A Relevance:**
1.  **Preliminary M&A Narrative:** Based *only* on the available YF/Web information, what initial "story" emerges about this company as an M&A target? (e.g., Is it presented as a growth opportunity needing financial validation? A niche tech asset with unclear market traction? A stable but slow-moving player? A situation with significant red flags needing immediate investigation?).
2.  **Key Themes (Strengths/Attractions - Speculative):** What 2-3 potential strengths or attractive aspects stand out from the analysis (e.g., apparent market niche leadership, positive product reviews found online, seemingly consistent reported growth)? Note the evidence basis (YF hint, Web mention) and the need for verification.
3.  **Key Themes (Risks/Red Flags - Speculative):** What 2-3 major risks or red flags are most prominent (e.g., concerning financial signals from YF/Web, strong competitive threats identified, negative management/governance hints, significant data gaps in critical areas)? Note the evidence basis and the need for verification.
4.  **Remaining Critical Uncertainties:** List the 3-5 most important unanswered questions that *must* be addressed through deep diligence using official sources before any M&A decision could be made.
